# Equation-Explorer-Python-Game
This game was developed for my assignment. This game implemented the concept of the game Wordle, with the implementation of randomization and mathematics. It was developed using the Python programming language.

The way that this game work, is whenever a user run this program, a random number between 1-3 is generated. Then based on this number, a riddle type will be selected. Then based on that number, an equation that belongs to the selected type will be generated randomly. A function to check whether the answer is correct will be executed. In this part, it ran similar on how the game Wordle works, whereby the answer will be highlighted green, yellow, or grey depending on whther the character is in the right place, or even exist in the equation itself. In the last part of the game, a solution of the equation is calculated, and the user need to use their math knowledge to solve it.
